# Remove Edge Hourly Task

# ⚠️ PROFANITY. THIS REPO WAS CREATED OUT OF PURE ANGER HATRED AND DISGUST AT MICROSOFT

Microsoft is the worst piece of shit to exist in humanitys existence. I hope Microsoft goes though severe bankrupcy and everyone responsible, the team leads, the developers burn in hell for their creations.

They're using a MOTHER***in WebView in THE FU***in start menu of all places. These INCOMPETENT dei hire M****f***ers know nothing other than html and css to `border-radius: 5px` and `backdrop-filter: blur(MY BALLSpx)` the shit out of the stat menu.

You know whats the worst part? you uninstall edge and it keeps returning back to your FUC**n PC that "YOU" BOUGHT and "YOU" paid for.

I DONT WANT A BROWSER RUNNING IN MY PC 24/7 cause YOUR RET**DED ASS CANT WRITE C++ CODE OTHER THAN CSS, AND YOU WERE HIRED CAUSE YOU'RE "DIVERSE" F*** OFF
